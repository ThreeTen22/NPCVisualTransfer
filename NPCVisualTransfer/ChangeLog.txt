0.3.1:
- Now allows for renumbering conflicting formIDs.  This will make sure that no record gets lost or your esp gets corrupted after transfering a conflicting record.

0.3 - More options!
- Added an additional options form that pops up during transfer, so far there are two options.
  - 1. Transfer Default and Sleeping Outfits.
       -Rather than automatically doing so, you now have the option of transferring these default outfits, or sticking with the outfit already on the npc.
  - 2. Force Opposite Animations
       -You now have the option to turn opposite animations on irregardless of whether the npc you are transfering your visuals to has it selected or not.
-Note: These options cannot be applied to already modified NPCs.

0.2 - Standalone Update!
- Removed the need for your patch to require the masters of the NPCs whose visuals you transfered.
  - (ex.  If you used npcA's visuals onto npcB, you no longer need the esp file where npcA originated from).
  -  Note: This still requires that the MODFILE of any npc whose visuals you use still be active in Mod Organizer.
           You can safely merge these modfiles to save space as well as delete any meshes/textures which are not relevant.
  - Depending on how this functions I may take it a step further and also make a copy of all of the assets
    (But I would rather not If I didn't have to).
    
- Modified the NPC creation/deletion system to compensate for this change.  Visually there will be nothing different apart from more debug information while patching. (Which may be needed to squash bugs.)
