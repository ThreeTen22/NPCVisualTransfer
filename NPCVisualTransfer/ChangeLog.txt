0.2 - Standalone Update!
- Removed the need for your patch to require the masters of the NPCs whose visuals you transfered.
  - (ex.  If you used npcA's visuals onto npcB, you no longer need the esp file where npcA originated from).
  -  Note: This still requires that the MODFILE of any npc whose visuals you use still be active in Mod Organizer.
           You can safely merge these modfiles to save space as well as delete any meshes/textures which are not relevant.
  - Depending on how this functions I may take it a step further and also make a copy of all of the assets
    (But I would rather not If I didn't have to).
    
- Modified the NPC creation/deletion system to compensate for this change.  Visually there will be nothing different apart from more debug information while patching. (Which may be needed to squash bugs.)

NPC Visual Transfer beta!
--Created The ability for one to transfer the visuals of any NPC onto another NPC of the same type.  
---Experimental: Can also transfer the visuals of Humanoid npcs to beast npcs but usually they don't do too much.
---For Instructions, take a look at the instructions.txt file!
